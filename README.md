Advisor: Weiyao Lin http://wylin2.drivehq.com/

##Overview
• DetectTrack is a real-time video analysis application using C++ and OpenCV.

• The detection stage extracts vehicle objects from video with Gaussian Mixture Background Model and frame difference. The
tracking stage tracks detected objects with particle ﬁlter algorithm.

• Optimized for handling complex trafﬁc scene, self-adaptive and non-sensitive to illumination variation.

##Dependency
OpenCV 2.3.1 or above. GSL 1.8 or above.
